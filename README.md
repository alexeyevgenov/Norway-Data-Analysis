In the process of passing an interview in one of the companies, I was offered the following test task. It seemed to me very interesting because, firstly, I am not a specialist in the field of geology, secondly, there were a large number of gaps in the dataset, and thirdly, it was a multi-class classification task with a large imbalance. In "Report 1 Part" I do EDA, and in "Report 2 Part" I test various hypotheses and create a pipeline for the model. As a method for filling gaps, I settled on the average value of a feature depending on its label, after removing features with gaps greater than 50%. This made it possible to increase the prediction accuracy on the baseline from 77% to 91%. I am using CatBoost as a model. After tuning the model, the accuracy increased to 97%
